The java.io, java.nio and java.nio subpackages provide most of the Java support for IO processing.

There are three key concepts used in the NIO package:

1) Channel: This represents a stream of data between applications.
2) Buffer: This works with a channel to process data.
3) Selector: This is a technology that allows a single thread to handle multiple channels.

There are 4 primary channels:

1) FileChannel: This works with a file.
2) DatagramChannel: This supports UDP communications.
3) SocketChannel: This is used with a TCP client.
4) ServerSocketChannel: This is used with a TCP server.
